# Python Specialist Assessment

## This is a program that collects user inputs, converts the current time to UTC, and returns the critical value that drives a business decision.
This was accomplished using the python package called dash

Packages required for installation:
- dash 
- dash_core_component
- dash_html_component
- dash.dependencies Input, output

The Python version is 3.10.0, but it also works on later versions.

I have also included the.py file containing the entire code, as well as a requirement.txt file that explains how to run the code.
