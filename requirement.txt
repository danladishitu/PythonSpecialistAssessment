Visual studio code was the text editor I used to run the app.
The Python version is 3.10.0, but it also works on 3.8.
Packages required for installation:
dash 
dash_core_component
dash_html_component
dash.dependencies Input, output

After running the code, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/. and then press ctrl+c to exit
